## GongPong
### Description

This is a program that recreates the game "Ping-Pong" in C++ with a few extra features. It is strictly singleplayer with 4 types of "AI" that vary in levels of difficulty. In fact, one of them should be impossible to score a point against.

### Reason

Got bored and decided to create this game in a couple hours. Had a great time making it.

### Controls
#### R: Reset/Startover    
#### M: Change "AI" Difficulty  
#### A/Left Arrow: To Move Left
#### D/Right Arrow: To Move Right

### Misc.

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
